# Homepage_v01
This projecrt is one of the first pages i developped. standing for a local homepage and where all my shortcuts were store

This page is decomposed as few parts but principaly 2 things were mix: personnal things and " pro " things. 

On a first hand, i stored all my shortcuts, for my favorits video games for exemple or the shortcuts to visits the pages I like as Facebook, google, netflix, G-mail etc.. This page saved me a lot of time over the year, since 2020. 

In the second Hand, i saved a lot of things that i called "pro-things", meaning, i wanted to became professional skills. I was curious and i've seen a lot of tech that i should have learn, as React, C#, .Net , UMl, Docker... To be sure i will not forget them, i've written them into a code line. 

Three years later, i'm still looking for learning a lot of them i recognize. 

By the way, this page wasn't fixed like it is today. I've been working of it though the years and then left for an other project.

This page is a relic of my past
